### What I learned

I learned how to use the DOM and how you can use querySelector to grab specific elements, classes, ids, or any other attribute.
I learned about the different properties that you can use on Input elements.
```js
const number = document.querySelector('#number-to-convert');
// querySelector grabs the ID of number-to-convert. 
const userNumber = input.value;
// input.value is the number(value) a user puts into the number input field.
```
