## Overview
A simple unit converter that converts imperial to mertic or metric to imperial. The default is 20 for all units, but the user can input there own measurements to be converted.
### Purpose

Users should be able to:

- Input information into the input field and recieve the conversions for their number.

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

I learned how to use the DOM and how you can use querySelector to grab specific elements, classes, ids, or any other attribute.
I learned about the different properties that you can use on Input elements.
```js
const number = document.querySelector('#number-to-convert');
// querySelector grabs the ID of number-to-convert. 
const userNumber = input.value;
// input.value is the number(value) a user puts into the number input field.
```
